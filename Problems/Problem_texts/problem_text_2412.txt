You are given an array A of size N.
A partitioning of the array A is the splitting of A into one or more non-empty contiguous subarrays such that each element of A belongs to exactly one of these subarrays.
Find the number of ways to partition A such that the parity of the sum of elements within the subarrays is alternating. In other words, if Si​ denotes the sum of the elements in the i-th subarray, then either

S1​ is odd, S2​ is even, S3​ is odd and so on.
or S1​ is even, S2​ is odd, S3​ is even and so on.

For example if A=[1,2,3,3,5]. One way to partition A is [1,2][3,3][5]. Another way to partition A is [1][2][3][3,5]. Note that there exists more ways to partition this array.
Since the answer may be large, output it modulo 998244353.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N - the size of the array A.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​ denoting the array A.

Output Format
For each test case, output the answer modulo 998244353.
Constraints


1≤T≤10000
1≤N≤2⋅105
0≤Ai​≤109
