Chef has two integers X and S. He is interested in sequences of non-negative integers such that the sum of their elements is S and the bitwise OR of their elements is X. Chef would like to know the shortest possible length such a sequence can have.
Formally, find the smallest positive integer N such that there exists a sequence A=[A1​,A2​,…,AN​] satisfying the following conditions:

Each Ai​ is a non-negative integer
A1​+A2​+…+AN​=S
A1​∨A2​∨…∨AN​=X

where ∨ denotes the bitwise OR operation.
If there does not exist any sequence which satisfies the above conditions, output −1. Otherwise, output the minimum possible length of such a sequence.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing two space-separated integers X and S — the required bitwise OR and sum, respectively.

Output Format
For each test case, output a single line containing one integer — the shortest possible length of such a sequence, or −1 if no such sequence exists.

Explanation:
Test Case 1: One of the valid arrays of length 3 is [9,9,5]. It can be shown that there is no valid array with length <3.
Test Case 2: There does not exist any sequence whose sum is 13 and bitwise OR is 6.
Test Case 3: The valid array of minimum length contains 25 ones.
