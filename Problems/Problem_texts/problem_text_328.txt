You are given an array A of N positive and pairwise distinct integers.
You can permute the elements in any way you want.
The cost of an ordering (A1​,A2​,…,AN​) is defined as (((A1​modA2​)modA3​)......)modAN​ where XmodY means the remainder when X is divided by Y.
You need to find the maximum cost which can be attained through any possible ordering of the elements.
Input:

The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each testcase contains a single integer N.
The second line of each testcase contains N space-separated integers, the elements of A.

Output:

For each testcase, output the maximum possible cost in a new line.
Constraints

1≤T≤5∗105
2≤N≤5∗105
1≤Ai​≤109
Sum of N over all testcases is less than or equal to 106
All elements in a single testcase are distinct.

7 127
Explanation:
The two possible ways to order the elements are [7, 12] and [12, 7]. In the first case, the cost is 7mod12=7 and in the second case the cost is 12mod7=5. Clearly the answer is 7.
