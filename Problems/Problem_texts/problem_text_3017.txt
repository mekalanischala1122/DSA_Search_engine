Nayra doesn't like stories of people receiving random trees as birthday presents, but this time she received a tree as a present for her own birthday! After struggling for a day trying to figure out what to do with this tree, she asked Aryan for help. He gave her this problem.
You are given a tree with N vertices and weighted edges. It is rooted at vertex 1.
Define g(u,v) to be the maximum weight of an edge on the shortest path between vertex u and vertex v in this tree.
Just calculating g(u,v) is too easy, so you have to process Q queries.
In each query, you are given K distinct vertices v1​,v2​,…,vK​. You have to compute the sum of the g-values of each pair of vertices among these K, i.e, the value
∑i=1K−1​∑j=i+1K​g(vi​,vj​)
Note: The input and output are large, so use fast input-output methods.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q, denoting the number of vertices in the tree and the number of queries respectively.
The second line contains N−1 space-separated integers P2​,P3​,…,PN​, where Pi​ is the parent of vertex i.
The third line contains N−1 space-separated integers W2​,W3​,…,WN​, where Wi​ is the weight of the edge between vertices i and Pi​.
The next Q lines contain queries you will have to answer. The description of Q queries follows.
The i-th line contains an integer Ki​ followed by Ki​ distinct space-separated integers v1​,v2​,…,vKi​​, where Ki​ is the number of vertices in this query and v1​,v2​,…vKi​​ denote the vertices themselves.

Output Format
For each test, print one line containing Q space-separated integers. The i-th of these integers should be the answer to the i-th query.

4 2 3 7 8
320 410

Explanation:
In the second sample:
Let's look at different values of g(u,v) for this tree.
For the first query, g(1,4)=40, g(1,5)=50, g(1,6)=60, g(4,5)=50, g(4,6)=60, g(5,6)=60. The sum of all these values is 320.
For the second query, g(2,3)=30, g(2,7)=70, g(2,8)=80, g(3,7)=70, g(3,8)=80, g(7,8)=80. The sum of all these values is 410.
Note: The second sample does not satisfy the constraint Ki​≥10, so it won't be present in the actual test data. It's added here only for illustration.
