You are given a tree with N nodes rooted at node 1.
The ith node of the tree has a value Ai​ assigned to it.
For the ith node (1≤i≤N), output the minimum value of bitwise XOR of the values of any two distinct nodes in the subtree of node i.
Formally, for each node i, find the value of min(Ax​⊕Ay​), where x=y and x,y∈ subtree of node i.
Note that since leaf nodes have only 1 node in their subtree, output −1 for all the leaf nodes.
Input Format

First line will contain T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case begins with a single line of input, an integer N - the number of nodes in the tree.
The following (N−1) lines each contain two integers, U and V, denoting an undirected edge between nodes U and V.
The last line of each test case contains N integers. The ith integer is the value assigned to ith node.

It is assured that the edges given in the input form a tree.
Output Format
For each test case, output N integers where the ith integer is the minimum value of bitwise XOR of the values of any two distinct nodes in the subtree of node i.
If node i is a leaf node, output −1 instead.
Constraints


1≤T≤105
1≤N≤105
1≤U,V≤N and U=V
0≤Ai​≤1015
It is guaranteed that the edges given in the input form a tree.
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 105.

Explanation:
Test case 1: There is only one node in the tree which is a leaf node. Hence, the output is −1.
Test case 2: The tree formed by the input of second test case is shown below:


Nodes 2 and Node 3 are leaf nodes. Hence, the answer for them is −1.
For the subtree formed by node 1, the answer is min((4⊕5),(5⊕6),(4⊕6)) which is min(1,3,2)=1.
