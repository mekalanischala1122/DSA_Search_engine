You are given two integers X and Y. You need to construct two different strings S1​ and S2​ consisting of only the characters ‘a’ and ‘b’, such that the following conditions are satisfied:

Both S1​ and S2​ are palindromes.
Both S1​ and S2​ should contain exactly X occurrences of a and Y occurrences of b.

If there are multiple possible answers, you may print any of them. If it is not possible to construct two distinct strings satisfying the conditions, print −1 instead.
Input Format

The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two space-separated integers X,Y.

Output Format
For each test case:

If it is not possible to construct two distinct strings satisfying the conditions, print −1
Otherwise, print two lines — the first should contain the string S1​ and the second should contain S2​
If there are multiple possible answers, you may print any of them.

Constraints


1≤T≤1000
1≤X,Y≤103

Explanation:
Test case 1: The three palindromes containing 2 a-s and 4 b-s are abbbba,babbab, and bbaabb. Printing any two of these is a valid answer.
Test case 2: There are no palindromes containing 3 each of a and b.
