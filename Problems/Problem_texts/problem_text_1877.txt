A string with length L is called rich if L≥3 and there is a character which occurs in this string strictly more than L/2 times.
You are given a string S and you should answer Q queries on this string. In each query, you are given a substring SL​,SL+1​,…,SR​. Consider all substrings of this substring. You have to determine whether at least one of them is rich.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
The second line contains a single string S with length N.
Each of the next Q lines contains two space-separated integers L and R describing a query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing the string "YES" if the given substring contains a rich substring or "NO" if it does not contain any rich substring.
