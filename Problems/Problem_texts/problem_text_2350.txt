Recently, Chef found a new formula for computing powers of a sequence:

You are given two sequences A1​,A2​,…,AN​ and (l1​,r1​),(l2​,r2​),…,(lN​,rN​).
The 1-st power of the sequence A is A1=A.
For each k>1, the k-th power of the sequence A (denoted by Ak) is a sequence with length N such that for each valid i, the i-th element of this sequence is (Ak)i​=(Ak−1)li​​⊕(Ak−1)li​+1​⊕…⊕(Ak−1)ri​−1​⊕(Ak−1)ri​​.

After discovering this new formula, Chef tried to find AK, but he felt that it is very time consuming. Therefore, Chef wants you to do it. Can you find the K-th power of A for Chef?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.
N lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers li​ and ri​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers (AK)1​,(AK)2​,…,(AK)N​.
Constraints

1≤T≤3
1≤N≤500
1≤K≤5⋅107
1≤Ai​≤1018 for each valid i

Example case 1:

(A2)1​=A1​⊕A2​=1⊕2=3
(A2)2​=A2​⊕A3​=2⊕3=1
(A2)3​=A1​⊕A2​⊕A3​=1⊕2⊕3=0
