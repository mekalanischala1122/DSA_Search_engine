You are given a directed graph G with N vertices (numbered 1 through N) and M edges. Let's denote the set of its vertices by V, the set of its edges by E and an edge from a vertex u to a vertex v by (u,v). Then, let's define:

For each u,v∈V, R(u,v) is true if v can be reached from u or false otherwise. Specifically, if u=v, it is always true.
For each v∈V, a set of vertices N(v)={u∈V∣R(u,v)∧R(v,u)}.
For each subset U⊆V, two sets of edges Out(U)={(u,v)∈E∣u∈U} and In(U)={(v,u)∈E∣u∈U}.

You need to assign a label to each edge in E; you may only use labels 1 and 2. The costs of labelling an edge are c1​ and c2​ for the labels 1 and 2 respectively.
In the resulting graph, Q constraints (numbered 1 through Q) need to be satisfied. For each valid i, the i-th constraint is that the number of edges in a set Si​ with the label xi​ should be between li​ and ri​ (inclusive); Si​ is determined by a given vertex wi​ and the type of this constraint ti​ as follows:

ti​=1: Si​=Out(N(wi​))
ti​=2: Si​=In(N(wi​))
ti​=3: Si​=Out({wi​})
ti​=4: Si​=In({wi​})

Find the smallest cost of labelling all the edges in such a way that these Q constraints are satisfied or determine that there is no solution satisfying all constraints.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, M and Q.
Each of the following M lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting a directed edge (u,v).
The next line contains two space-separated integers c1​ and c2​.
Q lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains five space-separated integers ti​, wi​, xi​, li​ and ri​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the smallest cost of labelling the edges or −1 if it is impossible to label the edges in such a way that all constraints are satisfied.
