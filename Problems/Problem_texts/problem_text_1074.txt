Chef has a set S containing N distinct integers.
Chef wants to gift Chefina an array A of any finite length such that the following conditions hold true:

Ai​∈S ∀i. In other words, each element of the array A should belong to the set S.
Mean value of all the elements in A is exactly X.

Find whether there exists an array A of finite length satisfying the above conditions.
Input Format

First line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
First line of each test case contains two integers N and X - denoting the size of set S and the mean value of the required array.
Second line contains N distinct integers S1​,S2​,…,SN​ - denoting the set S.

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line, YES if there exists an array satisfying the given conditions, NO otherwise.
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YES, yEs, yes, and yeS will all be treated as identical).
Constraints


1≤T≤1000
1≤N≤105
1≤Si​≤109
1≤X≤109
Si​=Sj​ for i=j
Sum of N over all test case do not exceed 2⋅105.

Explanation:
Test Case 1: One of the valid arrays is A=[2,2]. Here, 2∈{1,2,3}. Also, mean value of the array is 22+2​=2.
Test Case 2: Since all elements of the array can only be equal to 3, the mean value of A cannot be equal to 5.
Test Case 3: One of the valid arrays is A=[4,6]. Here, 4∈{4,6} and 6∈{4,6}. Also, mean value of the array is 24+6​=5.
Test Case 4: One of the valid arrays is A=[5]. Here, 5∈{5}. Also, mean value of the array is 15​=5.
