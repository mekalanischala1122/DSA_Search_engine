Dr.D is bored, so he's making up problems to pass the time. Here is one of them.
You are given a sequence A1​,A2​,…,AN​. Find the number of 7-tuples of indices (a,b,c,d,e,f,g) such that:

1≤a<b<c<d<e<f<g≤N
Ag​<Ae​<Af​<Ad​<Ab​<Ac​<Aa​

Since this number could be huge, compute it modulo 987654319.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output

Print a single line containing one integer — the number of tuples modulo 987654319.

Constraints

1≤N≤3,000
1≤Ai​≤109 for each valid i
