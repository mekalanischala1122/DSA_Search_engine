Given a binary number (of N bits) X. Find the highest power of 2 that divides this number.
Note: If the binary number is "100" then the highest power of 2 that divides it is 2 (as 22 = 4)Input:
The first line contains N the number of bits in the number
The next line contains a binary number of N bits
Output:
The first and only line contains the max power of 2 that divides the given number
Constraints:
 1≤N≤105
 1≤X
