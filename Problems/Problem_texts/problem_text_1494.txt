Chef played an interesting game yesterday. This game is played with two variables X and Y; initially, X=Y=0. Chef may make an arbitrary number of moves (including zero). In each move, he must perform the following process:

Choose any positive integer P such that P⋅P>Y.
Change X to P.
Add P⋅P to Y.

Unfortunately, Chef has a bad memory and he has forgotten the moves he made. He only remembers the value of X after the game finished; let's denote it by Xf​. Can you tell him the maximum possible number of moves he could have made in the game?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer Xf​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum number of moves Chef could have made.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤Xf​≤109
