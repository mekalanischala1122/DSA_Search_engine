Problem
You are given an array A, consisting of N integers and Q queries. Each query is of the type:

L R: Given L and R, (1≤L<R≤N), your task is to output minimum XOR of any two elements from the subarray A[L,R] of array A.

More formally, for each query L, R, your task is to calculate minimum value of Ai​⊕Aj​ over L≤i<j≤R, where ⊕ denotes bitwise XOR.
Input Format

The first line contains two integers N,Q − the size of the array and number of queries.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,…,AN​ − the elements of the array A.
ith of the next Q lines contains two integers Li​,Ri​ − description of ith query.

Output Format
For each query, output minimum XOR on corresponding segment.

Explanation:
Query 1: The given subarray A[1,2] is [1,2]. Thus, the XOR is 1⊕2=3.
Query 2: The given subarray A[2,3] is [2,3]. Thus, the XOR is 2⊕3=1.
Query 3: The given subarray A[1,3] is [1,2,3]. The minimum possible XOR is 2⊕3=1.
