Let f(X) denote the number of set bits in X.
Given integers N and K, construct an array A of length N such that:

0≤Ai​≤K for all (1≤i≤N);
∑i=1N​Ai​=K

Over all such possible arrays, find the maximum value of ∑i=1N​f(Ai​).
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follow.
The only line of each test case contains integers N and K- the length of the array and sum of elements respectively.

Output Format
For each test case, output the maximum value of ∑i=1N​f(Ai​).
Constraints


1≤T≤104
1≤N≤109
0≤K≤109

Explanation:
Test case 1: Only one array is possible that is A=[7]. As 7=(111)2​, the number of set bits in 7 is 3. Thus, ∑i=1N​f(Ai​)=f(7)=3.
Test case 2: A possible array satisfying all the conditions is A=[3,0,3]. As 3=(11)2​, the number of set bits in 3 is 2. Similarly, the number of set bits in 0 is 0. Thus, ∑i=1N​f(Ai​)=f(3)+f(0)+f(3)=4. It can be proven that answer never exceeds 4.
