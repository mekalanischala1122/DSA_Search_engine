“You can make a lot by playing such games.”
Every player has to play a game of Ddakji with the recruiter in order to enter the squid game. Gi-Hun has played many rounds but was unable to win even once. The recruiter thus decided to give him a puzzle instead.
Gi-Hun is given an array A of N elements.
He can perform the following operation on array A any number of times:

Select any two indexes 1≤i,j≤N such that i=j and replace Ai​ with Ai​−Aj​.

His task is to find the minimum possible value of ∣A1​∣+∣A2​∣+…+∣AN​∣ attainable by performing these operations several (possibly, 0) times.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains N, the number of elements in the array.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers — A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output Format
For each testcase, print on a new line one integer — minimum possible value of ∣A1​∣+∣A2​∣+…+∣AN​∣.
Constraints


1≤T≤105
2≤N≤105
−109≤Ai​≤109
Sum of N across all test cases doesn't exceed 106

Explanation:
Test Case 1: Perform the operation with i=1 and j=2 four times. The array is now [0,1], and its value is ∣0∣+∣1∣=1.
Test Case 2: No operations need to be performed.
Test Case 4: Perform the following operations:

Choose i=4,j=2 and set A4​=6−2=4. The array is now [0,2,−2,4].
Choose i=4,j=2 and set A4​=4−2=2. The array is now [0,2,−2,2].
Choose i=2,j=4 and set A2​=2−2=0. The array is now [0,0,−2,2].

The value of the array is now ∣0∣+∣0∣+∣−2∣+∣2∣=4, and it can be proved that this is the minimum possible value.
