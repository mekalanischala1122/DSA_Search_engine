Problem
You are given an array B of length 2N . You have an unknown array A which is sorted and contains distinct elements. You need to find out the array A. B contains all the medians of each prefix and suffix of the array A.
A median is the middle element in a sorted array . [1,2,3,4] has median 2 and [1,3,4] has 3 as median.
Determine whether B is a valid array of some array A. If yes find the array A else print −1.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N.
The second line of each test case contains 2N space-separated integers B1​,B2​,…,BN​.

Output Format
For each testcase, output the valid array A or −1 if not possible.
Constraints


1≤T≤1000
1≤N≤105
1≤Bi​≤106
Sum of N overall testcases won't exceed 2∗105.

Explanation:

Test case 1: Assume the array A be [5,6,7]. The medians of the prefix arrays of A are

[5] = 5
[5,6] = 5
[5,6,7] = 6



The medians of the suffix arrays of A are

[7] = 7
[6,7] = 6
[5,6,7] = 6

Hence B contains all the medians above with the element 5 repeating exactly 2 times,
6 repeating exactly 3 times and 7 repeating only once.

Test case 2: no valid array A can be found.
