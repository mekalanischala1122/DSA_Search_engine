You are given an array A containing N positive integers. Find the number of pairs (i,j) such that 1≤i<j≤N and:
Ai​+Aj​≥Ai​⋅Aj​


The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The T test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the required answer.
Constraints


1≤T≤1000
2≤N≤2⋅105
1≤Ai​≤106
Sum of N over all cases won't exceed 2⋅105

Explanation:
Test case 1: The two pairs are (1,2) and (1,3), because:

A1​+A2​=4>3=A1​⋅A2​
A1​+A3​=5>4=A1​⋅A3​

Test case 2: No pairs satisfy the condition.
