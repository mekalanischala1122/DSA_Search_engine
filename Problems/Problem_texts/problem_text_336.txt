In order to establish dominance amongst his friends, Chef has decided that he will only walk in large steps of length exactly K feet. However, this has presented many problems in Chef’s life because there are certain distances that he cannot traverse. Eg. If his step length is 5 feet, he cannot travel a distance of 12 feet. Chef has a strict travel plan that he follows on most days, but now he is worried that some of those distances may become impossible to travel. Given N distances, tell Chef which ones he cannot travel.
Input:

The first line will contain a single integer T, the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case will contain two space separated integers - N, the number of distances, and K, Chef’s step length.
The second line of each test case will contain N space separated integers, the ith of which represents Di​, the distance of the ith path.

Output:
For each testcase, output a string consisting of N characters. The ith character should be 1 if the distance is traversable, and 0 if not.
