Appy loves balloons! She wants you to give her balloons on each of N consecutive days (numbered 1 through N); let's denote the number of balloons Appy wants on day i by Ai​. The problem is that you only have M balloons. Fortunately, you can give her candies instead of balloons as well. On each day i, Appy accepts Bi​ candies per each balloon you do not give her — formally, if you give Appy Xi​ balloons on day i, then you have to give her Ci​=max(0,Ai​−Xi​)⋅Bi​ candies as well.
Your task is to minimize the maximum number of candies you give Appy on some day — find the minimum possible value of max(C1​,C2​,C3​,...,CN​).
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and M.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.
The third line contains N space-separated integers B1​,B2​,…,BN​.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer — the minimum value of max(C1​,C2​,C3​,...,CN​).

Explanation:
If you give Appy 0,0,0,1,2 balloons on days 1 through 5, then the required numbers of candies on each day are 1,4,9,12,15. The maximum number of candies is 15, required on day 5.
