You are given N segments where each segment is of the form [Li​,Ri​] (1≤Li​≤Ri​≤N).
It is ensured that for any two segments X and Y, one of the following conditions hold true:

X∩Y=X,
X∩Y=Y, or
X∩Y=∅ (empty set)

Note that ∩ denotes the intersection of segments.
In other words, for any two segments, either one is completely inside the other or they are completely disjoint.
The ith segment (1≤i≤N) is assigned a value Vi​.
A subset S={S1​,S2​,…,Sk​} having k segments is considered good if there exists an integer array B of size k such that:

All elements of the array B are distinct.
Bi​ lies in the segment Si​.

Let the score of a good subset be defined as the sum of values of all segments of the subset. Find the maximum score of a good subset.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains integers N - the number of segments.
Each of the next N lines contains three integers Li​,Ri​, and Vi​, describing the ith segment.

Output Format
For each test case, output the maximum score of a good subset.
Constraints


1≤T≤105
1≤N≤105
1≤Li​≤Ri​≤N
1≤Vi​≤109
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅105.

Explanation:
Test case 1: A possible value of good subset is S=[A2​,A4​]. The array B=[2,3] such that 2 lies in the segment A2​ and 3 lies in the segment A4​. The sum of values of all segments of S is 10+20=30.
It can be proven that the score of a good subset does not exceed 30 in this case.
Test case 2: We can take S=[A1​,A2​,A3​,A4​].
The array B=[2,3,1,4].

For segment A1​, L=1 and R=3. Here L1​≤2≤R1​.
For segment A2​, L=2 and R=3. Here L2​≤3≤R2​.
For segment A3​, L=1 and R=1. Here L3​≤1≤R3​.
For segment A4​, L=1 and R=4. Here L4​≤4≤R4​.

The sum of scores of all segments of S is 4+5+10+13=32. It can be proven that the score of a good subset does not exceed 4+5+10+13=32 in this case.
