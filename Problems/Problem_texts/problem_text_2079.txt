
Given an array A with N positive integers - (A1​,A2​,…,AN​).
A partition of the array into subarrays refers to dividing the entire array into subarrays (ie. some continuous elements) such that each of the N elements is in exactly one subarray.
We call a partition of the array into subarrays as Valid, if this condition holds true: For all i, if i and i+1 are in the same subarray then Ai+1​ must be divisible by Ai​.
Now, among all such Valid partitions, we are interested in the partition with the minimum number of subarrays. It can be proved that there is a unique such partition. We will be interested only with this partition in the problem.
We call Si​ the index of the subarray in which element i lies.
We now want to support some operations on the array. In particular, there are Q operations of the form -

1 i X - Change Ai​ to X
2 i - Given i , output the smallest j such that Si​=Sj​. That is, the leftmost index which belongs to the same subarray as the i-th element.

Input:

First line will contain N and Q denoting the size of A and number of operations respectively.
The second line contains N values, the initial values of A.
The next Q lines contain the operations as stated above.

Output:

The answer for each query of type 2 on a new line.

Explanation:
Initially, A=[2,2,7,14,14] and S=[1,1,2,2,2] ( A2​ is divisible by A1​, A3​ is not divisible by A2​, A4​ is divisible by A3​, A5​ is divisible by A4​ )
After the first operation A=[3,2,7,14,14]  and S=[1,2,3,3,3]  (A1​ is 3 now and A2​modA1​=0 now)
After the second operation A=[3,6,7,14,14] and S=[1,1,2,2,2]  (A2​ is 6 now and A2​ is divisible by A1​ once again)
For the queries, we can look at the Si​ value for the given index and find the smallest index with the same value. Note here that the exact value of Si​ is irrelevant. We just want the first element of the same chain.
