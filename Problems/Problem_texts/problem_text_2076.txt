Chef is experimenting in his kitchen. He has N spices (numbered 0 through N−1) with types S0​,S1​,…,SN−1​.
You should answer Q queries. Each query is described by two integers L and R. In each query, Chef wants to use the spices SL​,SL+1​,…,SR​ in some order to make a dish. However, he has no clue about the order in which he should use them to make a perfect dish, so he wants to try all possible orders (sequences created by permuting these R−L+1 spices) to find out. Tell Chef the number of distinct orders (sequences) of spices he needs to try. Since this number can be very large, compute it modulo 109+7.
Two sequences of spices are considered different if there is a valid index i such that the type of the i-th spice in one sequence is different from the type of the i-th spice used in the other sequence.
Note that the input is encoded so that you have to answer the queries online.
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
The next line contains N space-separated integers S0​,S1​,S2​,…,SN−1​.
Each of the next Q lines contains four space-separated integers L1​, L2​, R1​ and R2​ describing a query. The parameters L and R can be calculated in the following way:

Let's denote the answer to the previous query by a; for the first query, a=0.
Calculate L=(L1​⋅a+L2​)%N and R=(R1​⋅a+R2​)%N.
Then, if L>R, swap L and R.



Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer — the number of distinct orders of spices modulo 109+7.
