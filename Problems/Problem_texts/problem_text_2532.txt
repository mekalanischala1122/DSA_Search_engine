Consider the infinite x axis. There are N impacts on this X-axis at integral points (X1​,X2​,....XN​)  (all distinct) . An impact at a point Xi propagates such that at a point X0, the effect of the impact is K∣Xi​−X0​∣. Given the point X0​, N and K. Assume the total impact on X0​ is M, find if it is possible to do so.
Note: You are not required to find the set X
Formally print "yes" if this is possible and "no" if not possible.
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
 Each testcase contains of a single line of input, four integers N,K,M,X0 

Output:

 The output of each test case is either "yes" or "no"
