You are given an array A of length N.
You can do the following operation on the array atmost once:

Choose any non-negative integer X and a subarray [L,R] (1≤L≤R≤N) and update Ai​=Ai​&amp;X for all L≤i≤R. Here &amp; denotes bitwise AND operation.

Find the maximum bitwise XOR of all the elements of the updated array you can achieve.
Input Format

First line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
First line of each test case contains an integer N - denoting the length of array A.
Second line contains N integers A1​,A2​,…AN​ - denoting the array A.

Output Format
For each test case, output the maximum XOR of all the elements of the updated array you can achieve.
Constraints


1≤T≤104
2≤N≤2⋅105
0≤Ai​<230
Sum of N over all test cases do not exceed 2⋅105

Explanation:
Test Case 1: We can choose the subarray [L,R] as [2,4] and X=0. Thus, A2​=3&amp;0=0,A3​=3&amp;0=0, and A4​=3&amp;0=0. The updated array is [3,0,0,0]. The bitwise XOR of all the elements of the updated array is 3⊕0⊕0⊕0=3.
It can be shown that the bitwise XOR of the updated array cannot exceed 3 after applying at most one operation.
Test Case 2: We can choose the subarray [L,R] as [1,2] and X=3. Thus, A1​=1&amp;3=1 and A2​=6&amp;3=2. The updated array is [1,2,4]. The bitwise XOR of all the elements of the updated array is 1⊕2⊕4=7.
It can be shown that the bitwise XOR of the updated array cannot exceed 7 after applying at most one operation.
