You are given a sequence of positive integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​. You should make all its elements equal by performing a sequence of operations.
In one operation, you may choose any contiguous subsequence Al​,Al+1​,…,Ar​ such that for each i (l+1≤i≤r), Ai​=Al​, i.e. a sequence of identical elements, then choose any integer x<Al​, and for each i (l≤i≤r), replace Ai​ by x. The integers x chosen in different operations may be different.
Find the smallest number of operations necessary to make all elements of the given sequence equal.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer ― the smallest number of operations.
Constraints
