For an array B consisting of distinct integers, its number of inversions is equal to the number of pairs (i,j) with 1≤i<j≤M such that Bi​>Bj​, where M is the size of B. If this number is odd, we will call array B odd. Otherwise, we will call it even.
Let's call a permutation P of integers from 1 to K good, if there exists a way to split it into two subsequences, each of which is odd.
For example, we can split [5,1,3,2,6,4] into subsequences [5,3,2] and [1,6,4], both of which are odd. There is no such split for the permutation [1,2,4,3,5,6].
For each K from 1 to N, find the number of permutations of integers from 1 to K, which are good. As this number may be very high, output each number modulo some prime P.
Input Format

The only line of the input contains two integers N,P.

Output Format
Print N space-separated integers, the Kth of which is the number of permutations of integers from 1 to K which are good. Output all values modulo P.
