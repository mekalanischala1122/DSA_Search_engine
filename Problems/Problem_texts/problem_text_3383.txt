Chef has a circular array A of N integers A1​,A2​…AN​ where AN​ and A1​ are considered adjacent.
The subarray Ai,j​ defined as an array formed using elements of A from ith index element to jth index element (both inclusive). Formally, Ai,j​ is defined as:

If i≤j, then the subarray of A from the index i to index j, both inclusive.
If i>j, then it denotes the subarray of A from index i to index N, followed by subarray of A from index 1 to index j.

A function f(B) is defined on an array B as the number of subarrays of B which have sum less than K.
Let S=∑i=1N​∑j=1N​f(Ai,j​). Find the value of S modulo 1,000,000,007.
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output:
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the value of S modulo 1,000,000,007.

Explanation
In the second test case, the array is [1,−1] and K=1.
f(A1,1​)=0
f(A1,2​)=2, because both the subarrays [1,−1] and [−1] have sum <K.
f(A2,1​)=2, because the array we are considering now is [−1,1], and both the subarrays [1,−1] and [−1] have sum <K.
f(A2,2​)=1
The sum of these is 5, which is the answer.
