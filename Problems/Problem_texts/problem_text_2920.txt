You are given a sequence of integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​. You have to answer Q queries.
In each query, you are given two integers L and R, and you have to find the number of ordered pairs (X,Y) such that L≤X,Y≤R and AX​≤AX​⊕AY​≤AY​. Here, ⊕ is the bitwise XOR operator.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.
Each of the next Q lines contains two space-separated integers L and R describing a query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of valid pairs.
Constraints

1≤T≤50,000
1≤N,Q≤5⋅105
0≤Ai​<230 for each valid i
1≤L≤R≤N
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅105
the sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅105
