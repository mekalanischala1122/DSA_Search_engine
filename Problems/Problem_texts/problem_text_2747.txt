There are N enemies standing from left to right with strengths S1​,S2​,…,SN​.
M bullets are to be fired from the left side such that only one bullet is fired at a time. The ith bullet (1≤i≤M) has power Pi​ and capacity Ci​.
This means that the ith bullet affects the first Ci​ alive enemies from the left side and decreases the strength of each of those Ci​ enemies by Pi​.
Once an enemy’s strength becomes less than or equal to 0, the enemy dies and its strength becomes 0.
Find the strength of all the enemies after all M bullets are fired.
Input Format

First line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.
The second line contains N space-separated integers S1​,S2​,…,SN​, denoting strength of the enemies.
The third line contains M space-separated integers P1​,P2​,…,PM​, denoting the power of the ith bullet.
The fourth line contains M space-separated integers C1​,C2​,…,CM​, denoting the capacity of the ith bullet.

Output Format
For each test case, output N space-separated integers denoting the final strength of the enemies.

Explanation:
Test case 1: Initial strength of the enemies is [51,84,24,19,77,10,34].

The power of the first bullet is 3 and the capacity is 2. This means that the first bullet reduces the strength of the first and second enemies by 3. The strength of the enemies after the first bullet is fired: [48,81,24,19,77,10,34].
The power of the second bullet is 6 and the capacity is 2. This means that the second bullet reduces the strength of first and second enemies by 6. The strength of the enemies after the second bullet is fired: [42,75,24,19,77,10,34].
The strength of enemies after third bullet is fired: [39,72,21,16,74,7,34].
The strength of enemies after fourth bullet is fired: [29,62,21,16,74,7,34].

Test case 2: Initial strength of the enemies is [10,5,4,8].

The power of the first bullet is 4 and the capacity is 2. This means that the first bullet reduces the strength of the first and second enemies by 4. The strength of the enemies after the first bullet is fired: [6,1,4,8].
The power of the second bullet is 2 and the capacity is 4. This means that the second bullet reduces the strength of the first four enemies by 2. The strength of the enemies after the second bullet is fired: [4,0,2,6]. Note that due to this bullet, the second enemy dies and its strength becomes 0.
The power of the third bullet is 3 and the capacity is 2. This means that the third bullet reduces the strength of the first two alive enemies by 3. The strength of the enemies after the third bullet is fired: [1,0,0,6]. Note that since the second enemy is already dead, enemies 1 and 3 are affected by this bullet.
