Problem
Read problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
You are given an array A of size N. Initially, the array is filled with 0-s.
There are M types of operations that you can perform on array A. The ith operation can be described by two integers (xi​,yi​). In this operation, you choose a set of indices S such that

1≤j≤N,
(jmodyi​)=0,
Aj​=0,

, then you set Aj​=xi​ for all j∈S.
You can perform the operations in any order, but one type of operation can't be done more than once. What is the maximum sum of integers of the array A you obtain if you perform the M operations optimally?
For example, consider the array A=[0,0,0,0].


Suppose x=3,y=2. Here you can choose indices 1 and 3 and set A1​=A3​=3. So the array A becomes [3,0,3,0]. In this operation you can't choose the indices 2 and 4 because (2mod2)=0, (4mod2)=0.


Suppose x=5,y=3 and you set A2​=5. So the array A becomes [3,5,3,0]. Here you can't choose index 1 because A1​>0 and index 3 because (3mod3)=0 and A3​>0. However, you could also set A4​=5.


Suppose x=4,y=4. Now you can't choose any index because Aj​>0  for all 1≤j≤3 and (4mod4)=0. So the array remains same.


Note: Since input-output is large, prefer using fast input-output methods.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each testcase contains M+1 lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N,M.
M lines follow. For each valid i, the ith of these lines contains two space-separated integers xi​,yi​ - parameters of the ith operation.

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the maximum sum of integers of the array A after M operations.
