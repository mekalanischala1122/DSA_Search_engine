You are given a sequence of non-negative integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​ and Q queries. A sequence is good if the bitwise AND of all its elements is a perfect square. In each query:

you are given two parameters L and R
consider the subsequence B=AL​,AL+1​,…,AR​
you should find the number of good contiguous subsequences of B

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.
Each of the following Q lines contains two space-separated integers L and R describing one query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer — the number of good contiguous subsequences.

Explanation:
Example case 1: For the first query, there is only one possible subsequence, [2]. The AND of its elements is equal to its only element 2, which is not a perfect square.
For the second query, there are six contiguous subsequences:

[1]; its AND is 1, a perfect square
[1,2]; its AND is 0, a perfect square
[1,2,3]; its AND is 0, a perfect square
[2]; its AND is 2, not a perfect square
[2,3]; its AND is 2, not a perfect square
[3]; its AND is 3, not a perfect square
