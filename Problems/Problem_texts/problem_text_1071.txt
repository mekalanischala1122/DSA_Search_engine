Chef has two integer sequences A1​,A2​,…,AN​ and B1​,B2​,…,BM​. You should choose N+M−1 pairs, each in the form (Ax​,By​), such that the sums Ax​+By​ are all pairwise distinct.
It is guaranteed that under the given constraints, a solution always exists. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and M.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.
The third line contains M space-separated integers B1​,B2​,…,BM​.

Output
Print N+M−1 lines. Each of these lines should contain two space-separated integers x and y denoting that you chose a pair (Ax+1​,By+1​).
Constraints

1≤N,M≤2⋅105
∣Ai​∣≤109 for each valid i
∣Bi​∣≤109 for each valid i
A1​,A2​,…,AN​ are pairwise distinct
B1​,B2​,…,BM​ are pairwise distinct

Explanation:
The chosen pairs and their sums are:

A3​+B2​=100+3=103
A1​+B1​=10+4=14
A2​+B1​=1+4=5
A1​+B2​=10+3=13

Since all sums are distinct, this is a correct output.
