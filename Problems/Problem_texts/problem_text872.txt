An N-bonacci sequence is an infinite sequence F1​,F2​,… such that for each integer i>N, Fi​ is calculated as f(Fi−1​,Fi−2​,…,Fi−N​), where f is some function. A XOR N-bonacci sequence is an N-bonacci sequence for which f(Fi−1​,Fi−2​,…,Fi−N​)=Fi−1​⊕Fi−2​⊕…⊕Fi−N​, where ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Recently, Chef has found an interesting sequence S1​,S2​,…, which is obtained from prefix XORs of a XOR N-bonacci sequence F1​,F2​,…. Formally, for each positive integer i, Si​=F1​⊕F2​⊕…⊕Fi​. You are given the first N elements of the sequence F, which uniquely determine the entire sequence S.
You should answer Q queries. In each query, you are given an index k and you should calculate Sk​. It is guaranteed that in each query, Sk​ does not exceed 1050.
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
The second line contains N space-separated integers F1​,F2​,…,FN​.
The following Q lines describe queries. Each of these lines contains a single integer k.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer Sk​.
Constraints

1≤N,Q≤105
0≤Fi​≤109 for each i such that 1≤i≤N
1≤k≤109
