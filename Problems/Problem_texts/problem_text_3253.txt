You are given an array A of length N, which initially is a permutation of integers from 1 to N.
We want to make the array empty by performing the following operation N times: choose any index i and remove Ai​ from A, which decrements the size of A by 1.
We will perform exactly N such operations. Apparently, there are N! ways to do this. But now we wonder how many ways satisfy that, during the process, the array doesn't contain any consecutive monotone triples?
A consecutive monotone triple is a tuple of consecutive elements (i,i+1,i+2)
which satisfy
A_i &lt; A_{i+1} \lt A_{i+2} or A_i &gt; A_{i+1} \gt A_{i+2}.
Since the answer may be large, print it modulo 109+7.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T − the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains the single integer N.
The second line of each testcases contains n integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​ − the initial array A.
Output Format
For each test case print a single integer − the answer modulo 109+7.
Constraints


1≤T≤1000

Ai​=Aj​ for i=j
Initially A doesn't contain consecutive monotone triples.

Explanation:
In the second testcase, an example of a valid deletion is [1,4,2,3]→[1,4,3]→[1,3]→[1].
Meanwhile [1,4,2,3]→[1,2,3]→[1,3]→[1] is not a valid deletion since [1,2,3] contains a consectutive monoton triple.
