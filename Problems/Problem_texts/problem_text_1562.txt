Chef has an array A with N elements. He wants to find N points P1​,…,PN​ with integer coordinates on the 2D coordinate plane such that, for all pairs of indices i and j (1≤i<j≤N), the Manhattan distance from Pi​ to Pj​ is Ai​+Aj​. Help him find any N points satisfying the condition, or state that no such points exist.
As a reminder, the Manhattan distance between the points (x1​,y1​) and (x2​,y2​) is defined as ∣x1​−x2​∣+∣y1​−y2​∣.
Input Format

The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The T test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output Format
For each test case, if there is no set of points satisfying the stated condition, output NO.
Otherwise, output YES on one line, then output N lines. Each line should contain two integers Xi​ and Yi​ (−1018≤Xi​,Yi​≤1018) denoting the x and y coordinates of the point Pi​ respectively.
It can be proven that if a solution exists, then a solution exists under the constraints above.
Output is case insensitive.
Constraints


1≤T≤104
1≤N≤2⋅105
1≤Ai​≤109

Explanation:


For the first test case, we can choose P1​=(3,9) and P2​=(13,17). The Manhattan distance between P1​ and P2​ is ∣3−13∣+∣9−17∣=18, and A1​+A2​=5+13=18.


For the second test case, we can choose P1​=(18,5), P2​=(10,1), and P3​=(1,16).

The Manhattan distance between P1​ and P2​ is ∣18−10∣+∣5−1∣=12, and A1​+A2​=8+4=12.
The Manhattan distance between P1​ and P3​ is ∣18−1∣+∣5−16∣=28, and A1​+A3​=8+20=28.
The Manhattan distance between P2​ and P3​ is ∣10−1∣+∣1−16∣=24, and A2​+A3​=4+20=24.



For the third test case, it can be proven that there does not exist 5 points satisfying these constraints.
