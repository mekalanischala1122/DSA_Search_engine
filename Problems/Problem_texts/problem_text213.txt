Problem
Salmon has some hidden numbers that he wants you to find!
Given an integer N, find and output any two integers A and B such that:

1≤A,B≤109, and
A∗B=N.

Input:
The first line of input consists of a single integer T (1≤T≤105) -- the number of testcases.
The next T lines will consist of one integer, N (1≤ N≤109).
Output:
For each of the T testcases, output two space-separated integers A and B.
