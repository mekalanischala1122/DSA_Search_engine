Chef has a circular sequence A of N non-negative integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​ where Ai​ and Ai+1​ are considered adjacent, and elements A1​ and AN​ are considered adjacent.
An operation on position p in array A is defined as replacing Ap​ by the bitwise OR of elements adjacent to Ap​. Formally, an operation is defined as:

If p=1, replace A1​ with AN​∣A2​
If 1 &lt; p \lt N, replace Ap​ with Ap−1​∣Ap+1​
If p=N, replace AN​ with AN−1​∣A1​

Here, '|' denotes the bitwise OR operation.
Now, Chef must apply operations at each position exactly once, but he may apply the operations in any order.
Being a friend of Chef, you are required to find a sequence of operations, such that after applying all the N operations, the bitwise OR of the resulting array is K, or determine that no such sequence of operations exist.
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K denoting the number of elements, and the required bitwise OR after operations.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output:
For each test case, if no valid sequence of operations exist, print -1.
Otherwise, print N space-separated integers in which i-th integer denote the position chosen in the i-th operation. If there are multiple valid sequences of operations, you may print any valid sequence.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
3≤N≤2∗105
0≤Ai​,K≤109
It's guaranteed that the total length of the arrays in one test file doesn't exceed 106

3 6
2 1 6
3 6
2 1 5
3 7
2 4 6
3 7
1 2 4
3 7
1 2 6

Sample Output:
2 1 3
-1
-1
-1
2 3 1

Explanation:
In the first test case, initially, the sequence is {2, 1, 6}.

Chef applies the operation on the 2nd index, so the sequence converts to {2, 6, 6}.
Next, Chef applies the operation on the 1st index, so the sequence converts to {6, 6, 6}.
Next, Chef applies the operation on the 3rd index, and this time sequence does not change.

The final sequence is {6, 6, 6}, and bitwise OR of this sequence is 6 that is equal to given K.
