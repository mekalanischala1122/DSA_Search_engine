Read problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
You are given a connected graph with N vertices (numbered 1 through N) and N−1 bidirectional edges. Also, you are given a sequence K1​,K2​,…,KN​.
Let's denote the distance between vertices u and v by d(u,v). Next, for each valid i, let's define Di​ as the maximum integer such that there are at least Ki​ vertices v with d(i,v)>Di​. (It can be proven that such integers exist for the given constraints.)
Your task is to find the values of D1​,D2​,…,DN​.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers K1​,K2​,…,KN​.
Each of the next N−1 lines contains two space-separated integeres u and v denoting that vertices u and v are connected by an edge.

Output
Print a single line containing N space-separated integers D1​,D2​,…,DN​.
Constraints

1≤N≤105
1≤Ki​≤N−1 for each valid i
1≤u,v≤N
