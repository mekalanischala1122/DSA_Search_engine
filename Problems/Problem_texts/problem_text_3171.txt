You are given a sequence of 16N positive integers a1​,a2​,…,a16N​. You may shuffle  this sequence in any way you choose, i.e. change it to any one of its permutations. Then, let
x=(a1​⊕a2​)⊗(a3​⊕a4​)⊗…⊗(a8N−1​⊕a8N​),
y=(a8N+1​⊕a8N+2​)⊗(a8N+3​⊕a8N+4​)⊗…⊗(a16N−1​⊕a16N​),
where ⊗ and ⊕ denote bitwise AND and XOR respectively.
Find the maximum possible value of x−y.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer N.
The second line contains 16N space-separated integers a1​,a2​,…,a16N​.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer — the maximum value of x−y.
Constraints

1≤N≤104
1≤ai​≤109 for each valid i

Explanation:
Since 1⊕1=2⊕2=0 and 1⊕2=3, it is easy to see that we should let a1​=a3​=a5​=a7​=2 and all the remaining elements ai​ should be 1.
