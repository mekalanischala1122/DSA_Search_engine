You are given a sequence A1​,A2​,…,AN​. For each k (1≤k≤N), let's define a function f(k) in the following way:

Consider a sequence B1​,B2​,…,BN​, which is created by setting Ak​=0. Formally, Bk​=0 and Bi​=Ai​ for each valid i=k.
f(k) is the number of ways to split the sequence B into two non-empty contiguous subsequences with equal sums.

Find the sum S=f(1)+f(2)+…+f(N).
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the sum S.
Constraints
