Concatenation of two integers is obtained as follows: First, convert both integers to strings. Then concatenate both strings into one and convert this concatenated string back to integer.
For example, concatenation of 6 and 7 is CONC(6,7)=67, concatenation of 123 and 45 is CONC(123,45)=12345.
You are given an array A consisting of N integers. You are also given two integers L and R. Find the number of pairs (i, j) such that  1≤i,j≤N and   L≤CONC(Ai​,Aj​)≤R
Note: Since the size of the input and output is large, please use fast input-output methods.
Input Format

The first line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains three integers N,L,R.
The second line of each test case line contains N integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line the number of suitable pairs.
Constraints


1≤T≤104
1≤N≤105
1≤L≤R≤1015
1≤Ai​≤107
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106.

Explanation:
Test case 1:


(i=1,j=1): CONC(A1​,A1​)=22 and 10≤22≤52.


(i=1,j=2): CONC(A1​,A2​)=25 and 10≤25≤52.


(i=2,j=1): CONC(A2​,A1​)=52 and 10≤52≤52.


(i=2,j=2): CONC(A2​,A2​)=55 and 10≤55 but 55≰52.


So there are three suitable pairs.
Test case 2: There is no suitable pair.
Test case 3: The suitable pairs are (2,1) and (1,2).
