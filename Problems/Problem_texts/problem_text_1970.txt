"It doesn't matter how tough you are, you are not going to win on your own."
N players advance to the 2nd round, the game is revealed to be "HoneyComb".
The players have to construct an array A. Each and every player is given "Ppopgi" (Dalgona candy),
and the ith player has to carve a number Ai​ in their "Ppopgi".
The players will qualify if the array A satisfies the following rules:

The sum of the squares of all the numbers carved should be a perfect square. Formally, i=1∑n​(Ai​)2 = K2 , where K is a natural number.
The number of distinct values in the array should not exceed min(10,N).

Gi-Hun wants everyone to qualify, so he asks you for help. Help him find an array A which satisfies these conditions.
If there are multiple arrays that satisfy the conditions, you may find any of them.
Note: N can be large enough that the array cannot be printed directly. Instead, describe the array in terms of its frequencies, i.e, print (value,frequency) pairs, where each pair suggests the number of times the value occurs in the array. If this is unclear, please look at the sample inputs and outputs.
Input Format

The first line of inputs contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer N, the length of the array to be constructed.

Output Format
For each test case, print the array A you construct in the following format:

The first line should contain a single integer K, the number of distinct values in the array A
(1≤K≤min(10,N)).
The next K lines hold the description of the array. The ith of these lines should contain two integers xi​ and yi​, denoting that xi​ occurs exactly yi​ times in A.

The pairs (xi​,yi​) should satisfy the following conditions:

1≤xi​≤109 and yi​≥1 for every 1≤i≤K
The xi​ must be pairwise distinct, i.e, xi​=xj​ if i=j
The sum of yi​ must be N, i.e, ∑i=1K​yi​=N

Constraints


1≤T≤100
1≤N≤109
1≤Ai​≤109

Explanation:
Test Case 2: 2 occurs 2 times, 3 occurs once, and 4 occurs 2 times in A. The sum of squares is thus 22+22+32+42+42=49, which is 72.
Test Case 3: 2 occurs twice, 3 occurs once, 4 occurs twice, and 24 occurs once in A. The sum of squares is 22+22+32+42+42+242=625, which is 252.
