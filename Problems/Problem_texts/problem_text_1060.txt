You are given an array A of length N.
Determine the count of subarrays of A which contain their length as an element.
Formally, count the number of pairs (L,R) (1≤L≤R≤N) such that: (R−L+1)∈{AL​,AL+1​,…,AR​}.
Input Format

First line will contain T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
First line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the length of the array A.
Second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​ - denoting the array A.

Output Format
For each test case, output the count of subarrays containing their lengths.
Constraints


1≤T≤1000
1≤N≤2⋅105
1≤Ai​≤N
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅105.

Explanation:
Test Case 1: There are 4 subarrays (i,j) containing their lengths. They are (1,1),(1,2),(2,3), and (3,3).
Test Case 2: There are 6 subarrays (i,j) containing their lengths. They are (1,2),(1,3),(1,5),(2,4),(3,3), and (3,5).
