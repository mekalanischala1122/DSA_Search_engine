Chef and his mother are going travelling. Chef's world consists of N cities (numbered 1 through N) connected by N−1 bidirectional roads such that each city can be reached from any other city using roads. For each city, we know its age — the number of years elapsed since the foundation of the city; let's denote the age of city i by ai​.
First of all, Chef and his mother have to decide what city they should visit first. Suppose that Chef chooses a city cc​ and his mother chooses a (not necessarily different) city cm​. The difference of their choices is the number of different bits in the binary representations of acc​​ and acm​​.
Chef will not argue with his mother if the parity of this difference is not equal to the parity of the length of the shortest path between cities cc​ and cm​ (the number of roads on the shortest path between them). Find the number of ways to choose the cities cc​ and cm​ such that Chef avoids quarreling with his mother.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
Each of the following N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers A and B denoting a road between cities A and B.
The last line contains N space-separated integers a1​,a2​,…,aN​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of valid pairs cc​,cm​.
Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤N≤105

Explanation:
Example case 1: The two possible choices are cc​=2,cm​=3 (their binary representations differ by one bit, the shortest path has length 2) and cc​=1,cm​=2 (there are two different bits in their binary representations and the shortest path has length 1).
