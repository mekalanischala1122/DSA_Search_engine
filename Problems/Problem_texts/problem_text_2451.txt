You are given a sequence of integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​. This sequence is circular ― for each valid i, the element Ai+1​ follows after Ai​, and the element A1​ follows after AN​.
You may insert any positive integers at any positions you choose in this sequence; let's denote the resulting sequence by B. This sequence is also circular. For each pair of its elements Bs​ and Bf​, let's denote the (non-circular) sequence created by starting at Bs​ and moving from each element to the one that follows after it, until we reach Bf​, by B(s,f). This sequence includes the elements Bs​ and Bf​.
For each K from 2 to N inclusive, find the smallest possible number of elements that need to be inserted into A to form a sequence B for which there is no subsequence B(p,q) such that:

The size of B(p,q) is at least K.
There is no pair of consecutive elements in B(p,q) such that their GCD is equal to 1.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing N−1 space-separated integers. For each i (1≤i≤N−1), the i-th of these integers should be the smallest number of inserted elements in a valid sequence B for K=i+1.
Constraints

1≤T≤2,000
2≤N≤105
1≤Ai​≤109 for each valid i
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅106
