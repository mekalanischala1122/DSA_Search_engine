You are given N strings S1​,S2​,…,SN​. Consider a complete undirected graph with N vertices (numbered 1 through N), in which the weight of an edge between vertices u and v is equal to the length of the longest common substring of Su​ and Sv​.
Find the maximum possible weight of a spanning tree of this graph.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
N lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains a single string Si​.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer --- the maximum weight of a spanning tree.
Constraints


1≤T≤100
1≤N≤100
for each valid i, Si​ contains only lowercase English letters
the sum of lengths of all strings over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅105


Subtasks

Subtask #1 (10 points): the sum of lengths of all strings over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅102
Subtask #2 (20 points): the sum of lengths of all strings over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅103
Subtask #3 (70 points): original constraints

Explanation:
Example case 1: The strings S2​,S3​ have a longest common substring with length 2, and the strings S1​,S3​ have a longest common substring with length 2. The spanning tree which contains the edges (2,3) and (1,3) has the maximum weight 4.
