Chef is really interested in the XOR operation. He wants to take a sequence A0​,A1​,…,AN−1​ and for each i from 0 to K−1 inclusive (in this order, one by one), perform the following operation:

Let's denote a=Ai%N​ and b=AN−(i%N)−1​ before this operation.
Change Ai%N​ to a⊕b, i.e. a XOR b.

Since Chef is busy, he asked you to find the final sequence he should get after performing these operations.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A0​,A1​,…,AN−1​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers ― the elements of the final sequence.
