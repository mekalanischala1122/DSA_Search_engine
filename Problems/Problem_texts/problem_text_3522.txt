You are given integers N,M,K and N integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.
You can perform the following operation at most K times:

Choose any integer x such that 0≤x<2M. Then, for each 1≤i≤N, you can replace Ai​ with Ai​⊕x, or leave it unchanged.

What is the maximum value of A1​+A2​+…+AN​ that you can achieve after this process?
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer T − the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.

Explanation:
In the first test case, one of the possible sequences of operations is the following:
First operation: Choose x=12, and XOR A1​,A2​ and A3​ with it, obtaining array [12,8,14,12].
Second operation: Choose x=3, and XOR A1​,A2​ and A4​ with it, obtaining array [15,11,14,15], with sum 55.
