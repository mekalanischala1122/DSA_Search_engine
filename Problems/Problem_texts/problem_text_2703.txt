You are given a sequence A1​,A2​,…,AN​ and an integer K. Determine if it is possible to reorder the elements of the sequence A into a sequence B1​,B2​,…,BN​ and choose a real number m in such a way that for each contiguous subsequence of B with length K, the arithmetic average of the elements of this subsequence is m. If it is possible, find one such reordered subsequence B.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to reorder the elements of A in the required way, or "NO" otherwise.
If it is possible, print a second line containing N space-separated integers B1​,B2​,…,BN​. If there are multiple solutions, you may print any one.
