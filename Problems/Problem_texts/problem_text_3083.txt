You are given two integers N,K such that K+1≤N≤2K−1. Your friend is hiding from you a permutation (P1​,P2​,…,PN​) of integers from 1 to N, whose elements are written cyclically.
Your friend doesn't tell you the permutation. Instead, he tells you this. For each i from 1 to N he will tell you Ai​ − the number of such integers j with 0 \le j &lt; K such that P((i+j)modN)+1​<Pi​.
Given A1​,A2​,…,AN​, find any permutation P producing them or tell that there is no such permutation.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer T − the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers N,K.
The second line of each test case contains N integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.
Output Format
For each test case, if there is no permutation producing array A, output −1. Otherwise, output N integers P1​,P2​,…,PN​ (1≤Pi​≤N, Pi​=Pj​ for i=j) − the required permutation. If there are several such permutations, you can output any.

Explanation:
In the first test case, (3,4,2,5,1) produces A=[1,2,1,3,0]. Indeed, there is one element among 4,2,5 smaller than 3, there are 2 elements among 2,5,1 smaller than 4, one element among 5,1,3 smaller than 2, three elements among 1,3,4 smaller than 5, and no elements among 3,4,2 smaller than 1.
It can be shown that array A from the second test case doesn't correspond to any permutation.
