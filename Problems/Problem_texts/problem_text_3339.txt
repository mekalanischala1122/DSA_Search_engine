You are given an array A consisting of N integers. You have to answer Q queries of the following two types:


1 L R (R>L) which asks you to find gcd(AL​,lcm(AL+1​,gcd(AL+2​,...,((R−L)mod2==1? gcd(AR−1​,AR​):lcm(AR−1​,AR​))…))).


2 L R (R>L) which asks you to find the same as above but lcm swapped with gcd and vice-versa.


Here lcm(a,b) and gcd(a,b) denotes the least common multiple and greatest common divisor of two integers a and b respectively.
Example: Consider the array A = [2,4,8,16,32,64].


Suppose a query is of the form 1 1 6, so it asks you to find:
gcd(2,lcm(4,gcd(8,lcm(16,gcd(32,64))))).


Suppose a query is of the form 2 1 5, so it asks you to find:
lcm(2,gcd(4,lcm(8,gcd(16,32)))).


Note: Since input-output is large, prefer using fast input-output methods.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each testcase contains Q+2 lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, N and Q.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.
Q lines follow. For each valid i, the ith of these lines contains three space-separated integers Typei​,Li​,Ri​, denoting the type and parameters of the ith query.

Output Format
For each query, output in a single line answer to the problem.

Explanation:
Test case 1: The answer for the first query is  =gcd(2,lcm(4,gcd(8,lcm(16,gcd(32,64))))) = gcd(2,lcm(4,gcd(8,lcm(16,32)))) = gcd(2,lcm(4,gcd(8,32))) = gcd(2,lcm(4,8)) = gcd(2,8) = 2.
The answer for the second query is =lcm(2,gcd(4,lcm(8,gcd(16,32)))) = lcm(2,gcd(4,lcm(8,16))) = lcm(2,gcd(4,16)) = lcm(2,4) = 4.
