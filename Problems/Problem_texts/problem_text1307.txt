Problem

Chef made N pieces of cakes, numbered them 1 through N and arranged them in a row in this order. There are K possible types of flavours (numbered 1 through K); for each valid i, the i-th piece of cake has a flavour Ai​.
Chef wants to select a contiguous subsegment of the pieces of cake such that there is at least one flavour which does not occur in that subsegment. Find the maximum possible length of such a subsegment of cakes.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum length of a valid subsegment.
