Chef gives you a sequence A of length N.
Let X denote the MEX of the sequence A. Chef is interested in the count of positive values k, such that, if every element Ai​ of A is replaced by max(Ai​−k,0), the MEX of the sequence still remains X.
Find the count of such values. If there are infinite such values, print −1 instead.
As a friendly reminder, the MEX of a sequence is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the sequence. For instance:

The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 because 0 does not belong to the sequence.
The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 because 0 and 1 belong to the sequence, but 2 does not.

Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N - the length of the sequence A.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output Format
For each test case print a single integer — the count of positive values k satisfying the given condition. If there are infinite such values, print −1 instead.
Constraints


1≤T≤104
1≤N≤105

Explanation:

Test case 1: There doesn't exist any value of k satisfying the given condition.
Test case 2: There are infinite values of k satisfying the given condition.
Test case 3: There is only 1 value of k satisfying the given condition: k=4. The MEX of the given sequence is 3. When every element Ai​ of the given sequence is replaced by max(Ai​−4,0), the sequence becomes [1,6,0,0,0,2,0], which also has MEX=3.
