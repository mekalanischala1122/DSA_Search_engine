You are given N non-negative integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​. You are allowed to perform following operation any number of times:

Choose any valid index i (1≤i≤N) and a positive integer M>0 and replace Ai​ with Ai​modM. That is, replace Ai​ with its remainder when divided by M, which is a value between 0 and M−1, inclusive.
M does not need to be same between different operations.

Find the minimum number of operations to make all the array elements equal.
Note: Since the input and output are large, prefer using fast input-output methods.
Input Format

The first line contains an integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N - the size of array.
The second line contains N integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​ - the elements of the array.

Output Format
For each test, print one line containing an integer which denotes minimum number of operations performed to make all the elements equal.
Constraints


1≤T≤104
1≤N≤105
0≤Ai​≤2⋅109
It is guaranteed that the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106.

Explanation:
In first test case, we can make all the elements equal by following operations:

Take i=1 and M=2 and do A1​:=A1​mod2=0.
Take i=2 and M=1 and do A2​:=A2​mod1=0.
Take i=3 and M=3 and do A3​:=A3​mod3=0.
After these 3 operations we have all the elements equal to zero.

In second test case, we can perform following operation:

Choose i=3 and M=2 and do A3​:=A3​mod2=1.
After this operation all the elements are 1.
