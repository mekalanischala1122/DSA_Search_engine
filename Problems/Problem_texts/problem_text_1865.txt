You are given a sequence A1​,A2​,…,AN​. Calculate the number of ways to remove a non-empty contiguous subsequence from it such that the resulting sequence is non-empty and strictly increasing.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of ways.
