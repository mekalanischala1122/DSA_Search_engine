Chef is given a sequence of integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.
Chef considers a contiguous subsequence Al​,Al+1​,…,Ar​ (where 1≤l≤r≤N) fruitful if it satisfies the condition
∣Al​−Ar​∣=max(Al​,Al+1​,…,Ar​)−min(Al​,Al+1​,…,Ar​).
Please help Chef find the number of fruitful contiguous subsequences of the sequence A.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of fruitful contiguous subsequences.
Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤N≤250,000
1≤Ai​≤109 for each valid i
