Chef has a permutation P1​,P2​,…,PN​ of integers 1 through N. He needs you to find the value of the sum
S=i=1∑N​j=i∑N​getMin(i,j)∧getMax(i,j),
where ∧ denotes the bitwise AND operation and
getMin(i,j)=min(Pi​,Pi+1​,…,Pj−1​,Pj​),
getMax(i,j)=max(Pi​,Pi+1​,…,Pj−1​,Pj​).
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers P1​,P2​,…,PN​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer S.
Constraints

1≤T≤2
1≤N≤105
