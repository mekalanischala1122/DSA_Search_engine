You're given an array of integers A and a permutation P, each of size N. Recall that a permutation of length N is an array where every element from 1 to N occurs exactly once.
The following operation is performed on the array K times:

For each index i (1≤i≤N), add APi​​ to Ai​ simultaneously.

For example, if A=[2,6,1,7] and P=[3,1,4,2], after one operation A=[2+A3​,6+A1​,1+A4​,7+A2​]=[3,8,8,13].
Find the values of A modulo 998244353, after performing the above operation K times.
Input Format

The first line contains two space separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space separated integers A1​,A2​,…AN​, the elements of the array A.
The third line contains N space separated integers P1​,P2​,…PN​, the elements of the permutation P.

Output Format
Print N space separated integers, the elements of the array A modulo 998244353 after performing the above operation K times.
Constraints


1≤N,K≤2⋅105
1≤Ai​<998244353
1≤Pi​≤N
It is guaranteed that P is a permutation.

2 6 1 7
3 1 4 2
32 22 42 32

Explanation:
The array A evolves as follows

A0=[2,6,1,7]
A1=[3,8,8,13]
A2=[11,11,21,21]
A3=[32,22,42,32]

where Ai denotes the array after i operations.
Thus, finally the elements of A read [32,22,42,32].
