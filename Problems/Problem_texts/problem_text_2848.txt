In Chefland, there are N cities (numbered 1 through N) connected by N−1 bidirectional roads. Each city has exactly one garden. For each valid i, let's denote the population of the i-th city by Ai​ and the initial number of fruits in its garden by Bi​; also, at any time, let's denote the current number of fruits in its garden by Fi​ (Fi​=Bi​ initially).
You are given a permutation P of the integers 1 through N. For each i (1≤i≤N), during the i-th of the next N days, the people of the city Pi​ do the following:

For each city j which is reachable from the city Pi​ (including the city Pi​ itself), visit the city j and consume min(APi​​,Fj​) fruits from the garden of the city j; afterwards, Fj​ decreases by min(APi​​,Fj​).
Return to the city Pi​ and cut off all the roads that are connecting it to other cities, so that nobody can visit the city Pi​ or visit any other city from their city if it requires passing through the city Pi​.

For each valid i, let Di​ be the first day when the number of fruits in the i-th city's garden becomes zero, or −1 if the fruits in its garden never end up all eaten. Find D1​,D2​,…,DN​.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
Each of the next N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting that vertices u and v are connected by an edge.
The next line contains N space-separated integers P1​,P2​,…,PN​.
The next line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.
The last line contains N space-separated integers B1​,B2​,…,BN​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers D1​,D2​,…,DN​.

Explanation:
Example case 1: The process is as follows:

On day 1, people from city 1 eat 1 fruit from each garden. Afterwards, there are [0,2,5] fruits in the gardens of cities [1,2,3] respectively, so the answer for city 1 is 1, since the number of fruits in this garden becomes zero on day 1.
Then, on day 2, people from city 2 eat 2 fruits from each of the gardens in cities 2 and 3. Afterwards, there are 0 fruits in the garden of city 2 (so the answer for city 2 is 2, since the number of fruits in this garden becomes zero on this day) and 3 fruits in the garden of city 3.
Finally, on day 3, people from city 3 eat 3 fruits from the garden of city 3, so the answer for city 3 is 3.
