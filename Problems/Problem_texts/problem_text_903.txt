Chef has an integer sequence A1​,A2​,…,AN​. For each index i (1≤i≤N), Chef needs to divide Ai​ into two positive integers x and y (ie. x,y>0) such that x+y=Ai​, then place this as a point (x,y) in the infinite 2-dimensional coordinate plane. Help Chef to find the maximum number of distinct points that can be put in the plane, if he optimally splits the values Ai​. Note that Chef can only perform one split for each index.
Note: Please use fast input/output methods for this problem.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum number of distinct points there can be in the infinite plane.

Explanation:
Test Case 1: Chef can divide A1​ as (1,1), A2​ as (1,1), A3​ as (1,3), A4​ as (2,2), A5​ as (1,1), A6​ as (2,4). Ignoring duplicates, there are 4 distinct points, which is the maximum possible.
Test Case 2: Chef can divide A1​ as (8,8), A2​ as (4,4).
