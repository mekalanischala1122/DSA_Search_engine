Hussain really likes problems that involve summation over X, where X can be subsets, paths in a tree, intervals of numbers etc.
You are given two integer sequences A1​,A2​,A3​,…,AN​ and B1​,B2​,B3​,…,BN​. Consider an arbitrary non-empty subset S of the set {1,2,…,N}. Let's define the swagness of such a set as
(max(p∈S)​Ap​)⋅(max(p∈S)​Bp​).
Hussain is interested in the sum of swagnesses of all possible sets S. (Note that there are 2N−1 such sets.) Since the sum may be very large, compute it modulo 109+7.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,A3​,…,AN​.
The third line contains N space-separated integers B1​,B2​,B3​,…,BN​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the total swagness modulo 109+7.
Constraints

1≤T≤1,000
2≤N≤2⋅105
1≤Ai​,Bi​≤106 for each valid i
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106
