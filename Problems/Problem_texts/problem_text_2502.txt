This is an interactive problem.
You are given a tree with N vertices (numbered 1 through N). Each vertex has a value; let's denote the value of vertex i by ai​. Vertex v is a bad adjacent of vertex u if there is an edge between vertices u and v and av​ is strictly greater than au​.
Your task is to find a vertex without any bad adjacent or determine that there is no such vertex. You do not know the values a1​,a2​,…,aN​, but you may ask up to 20 questions.
In each question, you should choose a vertex x; the grader responds with the number of some bad adjacent vertex of vertex x or with −1 if x does not have any bad adjacent.
Interaction

First, you should read a line containing a single integer — the number of test cases T. The description of interaction for T test cases follows.
For each test case, first, you should read a line containing a single integer N.
Then, you should read N−1 lines. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting that vertices u and v are connected by an edge.
Then, you may ask questions.

To ask a question, you should print a line containing two space-separated integers 1 and x (1≤x≤N).
Then, you should read a line containing a single integer y.
If the question was invalid or if you asked too many questions, y=−2. If x has no bad adjacent, y=−1. Otherwise, y is the number of a bad adjacent of x.


When you have determined the answer, you should print a line containing two space-separated integers 2 and x. If there is no vertex without a bad adjacent, x should be −1; otherwise, x should be the number of a vertex without a bad adjacent.
Finally, you should read a line containing a single integer: 1 if your answer is correct or −2 if it is incorrect. If your answer is correct, you should continue solving the remaining test cases.

Note that when you receive −2 (either as the response to a question or to your answer), you should immediately terminate your program to receive a Wrong Answer verdict; otherwise, you may receive any verdict.
Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!

Explanation
Example case 1: The values of vertices in the tree are a1​=3, a2​=10, a3​=20. Note that the answer to the first query could have been 3 instead of 2 as well.
Example case 2: The values of vertices in the tree are a1​=4, a2​=9, a3​=3 and a4​=3.
