For a permutation P of integers from 1 to N, let's define its value as (1⊕P1​)+(2⊕P2​)+…+(N⊕PN​).
Given N, find the maximum possible value of the permutation of integers from 1 to N.
As a reminder, ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer T − the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains a single integer N.
Output Format
For each test case, output the maximum possible value of the permutation of integers from 1 to N.
Constraints

Explanation:
For N=1, the only such permutation is P=(1), its value is 1⊕1=0.
For N=2, the permutation with the best value is P=(2,1), with value 1⊕2+2⊕1=6.
For N=3, the permutation with the best value is P=(2,1,3), with value 1⊕2+2⊕1+3⊕3=6.
For N=4, the permutation with the best value is P=(2,1,4,3), with value 1⊕2+2⊕1+3⊕4+4⊕3=20.
