You are given an array A of N non-negative integers, where N is odd. Find the minimum non-negative integer x that satisfies the equation
(A1​+x)⊕(A2​+x)⊕⋯⊕(AN​+x)=0
where ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation. If no such x exists, print −1.
Note: The input of this problem is large, so use fast input/output methods.
Input Format

First line of the input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, denoting the size of the array A.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated non-negative integers A1​,A2​…AN​.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer. If there does not exist any non-negative integer x that satisfies the given equation, print −1. Otherwise, print the minimum value of x that satisfies the given equation.

Explanation:
Test case 1:
We have to find minimum non-negative integer x such that
(2+x)⊕(4+x)⊕(5+x)=0
Let f(x)=(2+x)⊕(4+x)⊕(5+x).

For x=0, we have
f(0)=(2+0)⊕(4+0)⊕(5+0)=2⊕4⊕5=3
For x=1, we have
f(1)=(2+1)⊕(4+1)⊕(5+1)=3⊕5⊕6=0

Therefore, x=1 is the minimum non-negative integer that satisfies the given equation.
Test case 2:
We have to find minimum non-negative integer x such that
(0+x)⊕(0+x)⊕(0+x)=0
i.e. x⊕x⊕x=0. But since 0⊕0⊕0=0, it follows that x=0 is the minimum non-negative integer that satisfies the given equation.
Test case 3:
We have to find minimum non-negative integer x such that
(1+x)⊕(1+x)⊕(1+x)=0
But a⊕a=0 and 0⊕a=a for any non-negative integer a. It follows that
(1+x)⊕(1+x)⊕(1+x)=0⊕(1+x)=1+x
This implies that x satisfies the given equation if and only if it satisfies 1+x=0 if and only if x=−1. But −1 is a negative integer and therefore, there does not exist any x that satisfies the given equation.
Test case 4:
We have to find minimum non-negative integer x such that
(1+x)⊕(1+x)⊕(2+x)=0
It follows that
(1+x)⊕(1+x)⊕(2+x)=0⊕(2+x)=2+x
This implies that x satisfies the given equation if and only if it satisfies 2+x=0, which can only happen if x=−2. But −2 is a negative integer and therefore, there does not exist any non-negative x that satisfies the given equation, hence we output −1.
