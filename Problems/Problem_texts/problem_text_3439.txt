You are given a prime number P and two integers A,B. Your task is to find the minimum value of (AT⋅B)modP over all nonnegative integers T.


The only line of input contains three space-separated integers P,A,B.
It's guaranteed that P is prime.

Output Format
Output the minimum value of (AT⋅B)modP over all nonnegative integers T.
Constraints


3≤P≤1013
1≤A,B<P
P is a prime number.

Explanation:
Test case 1: Choose T=0 to get (20⋅3)mod7=3, which is the minimum possible value.
Test case 2: Choose T=1 to get (101⋅8)mod11=80mod11=3, which is the minimum possible value.
