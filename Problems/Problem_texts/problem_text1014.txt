Problem
Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.
You are given an integer sequence A1​,A2​,…,AN​. For any pair of integers (l,r) such that 1≤l≤r≤N, let's define OR(l,r) as Al​∨Al+1​∨…∨Ar​. Here, ∨ is the bitwise OR operator.
In total, there are 2N(N+1)​ possible pairs (l,r), i.e. 2N(N+1)​ possible values of OR(l,r). Determine if all these values are pairwise distinct.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if all values of OR(l,r) are pairwise distinct or "NO" otherwise (without quotes).
Constraints

1≤T≤300
1≤N≤105
0≤Ai​≤1018 for each valid i
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅105

Explanation:
Example case 1: The values of OR(l,r) are 1,2,7,3,7,7 (corresponding to the contiguous subsequences [1],[2],[7],[1,2],[2,7],[1,2,7] respectively). We can see that these values are not pairwise distinct.
Example case 2: The values of OR(l,r) are 1,2,3 (corresponding to the contiguous subsequences [1],[2],[1,2] respectively) and they are pairwise distinct.
