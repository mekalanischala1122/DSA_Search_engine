Problem
Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian.
Nobody knows, but N frogs live in Chef's garden.
Now they are siting on the X-axis and want to speak to each other. One frog can send a message to another one if the distance between them is less or equal to K.
Chef knows all P pairs of frogs, which want to send messages. Help him to define can they or not!
Note : More than 1 frog can be on the same point on the X-axis.
Input

The first line contains three integers N, K and P.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​, A2​, ..., AN​ denoting the x-coordinates of frogs".
Each of the next P lines contains two integers A and B denoting the numbers of frogs according to the input.

Output
For each pair print "Yes" without a brackets if frogs can speak and "No" if they cannot.
Constraints

1≤N,P≤105
0≤Ai​,K≤109
1≤A,B≤N

Sample 1:
InputOutput5 3 3
0 3 8 5 12
1 2
1 3
2 5Yes
Yes
No
Explanation:


For pair (1,2) frog 1 can directly speak to the frog 2 as the distance between them is 3−0=3≤K .


For pair (1,3) frog 1 can send a message to frog 2, frog 2 can send it to frog 4 and it can send it to frog 3.


For pair (2,5) frogs can't send a message under current constraints.
