
Given an array of n integers : A1​,A2​,...,An​, find the longest size subsequence which satisfies the following property: The xor of adjacent integers in the subsequence must be non-decreasing.


First line contains an integer n, denoting the length of the array.
Second line will contain n space separated integers, denoting the elements of the array.

Output:
Output a single integer denoting the longest size of subsequence with the given property.
Constraints

1≤n≤103
0≤Ai​≤1018

Sample Input:
8
1 200 3 0 400 4 1 7

Sample Output:
6

EXPLANATION:
The subsequence of maximum length is {1, 3, 0, 4, 1, 7} with Xor of adjacent indexes as {2,3,4,5,6} (non-decreasing)
