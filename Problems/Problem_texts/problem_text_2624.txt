You are given a convex polygon with N sides. You have to answer Q queries. The ith query is described by two integers vi​,ti​. In this query, all sides of the polygon start moving parallel to their respective perpendicular vector away from the centroid with a constant velocity of vi​secunits​. Output the final area covered by N sides of the polygon after time ti​ seconds.
For each query,  consider the initial coordinates of vertices of the given polygon.
Note:

Since the input-output is large, prefer using fast input-output methods.
The problem requires high precision, so prefer using data types with a precision equivalent to long double in C++.

Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each testcase contains N+Q+1 lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N,Q.
N  lines follow. For each valid i, the ith of these lines contains two space-separated integers xi​,yi​, coordinates of the ith vertex of the polygon.
Next Q lines follow. For each valid i, the ith of these lines contains two space-separated integers  vi​,ti​, description of the ith query.

Output Format
For each query, output in a single line the final area covered by N sides of the polygon.
Your answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error does not exceed 10−2.

Explanation:
Below are the images for the respective test cases. Inner polygons are the ones at the start and the rays represent the distance traveled by the sides at the given speed in a given time. Outer polygons denote the final ones after the movements of the sides.
