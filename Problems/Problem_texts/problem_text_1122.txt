At ShareChat, there are are plenty of interesting problems to solve. Here is one of them.
Given integers A, B and N, you should calculate the GCD of AN+BN and ∣A−B∣. (Assume that GCD(0,a)=a for any positive integer a). Since this number could be very large, compute it modulo 1000000007 (109+7).
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers A, B and N.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the required GCD modulo 109+7.

Explanation:
Example case 1: GCD(101+11,10−1)=GCD(11,9)=1
Example case 2: GCD(95+15,9−1)=GCD(59050,8)=2
