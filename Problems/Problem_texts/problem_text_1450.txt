The young but promising paparazzi Gennady wants to finally become famous. To do this, he wants to take a picture of a new super star during her walk in the mountains.
It is known that the star's path in the mountains consists of N sections. For each valid i, the i-th section is a vertical half-open interval with coordinates x=i and y∈[0,hi​).
For each valid i and j, our hero can take a picture of the star located in the i-th section of the walk when he is in the j-th section only if he can see the star ― that is, i<j and for each k (i<k<j), the half-open interval that makes up the k-th section must not intersect the line segment [(i,hi​),(j,hj​)].
Gennady is a paparazzi, not a programmer, so he asks you to determine the maximum distance from which he can take a picture of the star, which is the maximum value of j−i over all pairs (i,j). Help him become famous!
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers h1​,h2​,…,hN​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum distance.
Constraints

1≤T≤104
2≤N≤5⋅105
1≤hi​≤109 for each valid i
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅105

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (10 points): the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 500
Subtask #2 (10 points): the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 8,000
Subtask #3 (80 points): original constraints
