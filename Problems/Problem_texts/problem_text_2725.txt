Chef has met up with his old friend Jack recently. Jack told Chef that he found a recipe for an ancient dish, but unfortunately, it is locked in a safe and to open the safe, it is necessary to enter the solution to the following problem.
There is a sequence of non-negative integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​ on the safe. Find the number of pairs (l,r) (1≤l≤r≤N) which satisfy the condition (Al​∨Al+1​∨…∨Ar​)⊕(Al​∧Al+1​∧…∧Ar​)≥max(Al​,Al+1​,…,Ar​).
Here, ⊕ denotes bitwise XOR, ∨ denotes bitwise OR and ∧ denotes bitwise AND.
Jack and Chef cannot think of anything except the recipe, so you are asked to open the safe.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of pairs (l,r) that satisfy the given condition.
Constraints

1≤N≤106
0≤Ai​<260 for each valid i
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (10 points): for each valid i, Ai​ is a power of 2
Subtask #2 (30 points):

Ai​≤3⋅105 for each valid i
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅105

Subtask #3 (60 points): original constraints
