Problem
Read problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
Chef recently discovered a function XOR(), which computes the XOR of all elements of a sequence:
XOR(a1..n​)=a1​⊕a2​⊕⋯⊕an​.
Chef has a sequence A with size N. He generated a new sequence B with size N2 using the following formula:
BiN+j+1​=(Ai+1​+Aj+1​)∀0≤i,j<N.
Compute the value of XOR(B).
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the answer to the problem.

Explanation:
Example case 1: The sequence B is {A1​+A1​,A1​+A2​,A2​+A1​,A2​+A2​}={2,3,3,4}. The XOR of its elements is B1​⊕B2​⊕B3​⊕B4​=6.
