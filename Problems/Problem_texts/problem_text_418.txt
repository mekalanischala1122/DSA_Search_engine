From an array A containing N integers, you construct a binary string S of length (N−1) as follows. For all 1≤i<N:

If Ai​<Ai+1​, then Si​=0.
If Ai​>Ai+1​, then Si​=1.

Given the string S, determine the count of indices i (1≤i≤N) such that it is possible for Ai​ to be the maximum element of the array A.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N — the size of the array A.
The second line of each test case contains the binary string S of length (N−1) containing 0s and 1s only.

Output Format
For each test case, output the count of indices i (1≤i≤N) such that it is possible for Ai​ to be the maximum element of the array A.
Constraints


1≤T≤105
2≤N≤105
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 105.

Explanation:
Test case 1: Here A1​<A2​. Therefore clearly only A2​ can be the maximum element of A.
Test case 2: Here A1​<A2​, A2​<A3​, A3​<A4​, A4​>A5​, A5​>A6​ and A6​>A7​. Therefore, clearly only A4​ can be the maximum element of A.
Test case 3: Here A1​>A2​, A2​>A3​, A3​>A4​, A4​<A5​ and A5​<A6​. Therefore A1​ and A6​ both can be the maximum elements of A.
