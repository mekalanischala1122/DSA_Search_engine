You are given an array A=[A1​,A2​,…,AN​] containing N integers.
Consider any subarray [AL​,AL+1​,…,AR​] of this subarray (where 1≤L≤R≤N). Ther weirdness of this subarray, denoted w(L,R), is defined to be the number of indices L≤i≤R such that Ai​ equals the number of occurrences of Ai​ in this subarray.
Formally, we define w(L,R) for 1≤L≤R≤N as follows:

For every integer x, let fL,R​(x) denote the number of indices L≤j≤R such that Aj​=x.
w(L,R) then equals the number of L≤i≤R such that Ai​=fL,R​(Ai​)

For example, let A=[1,3,5,2,1,2,9,5]. Then,

w(1,8)=2, which can be computed as follows.
We have

f1,8​(1)=2
f1,8​(2)=2
f1,8​(3)=1
f1,8​(5)=2
f1,8​(9)=1



The only indices which satisfy f1,8​(Ai​)=Ai​ are i=4 and i=6, and hence w(1,8)=2.

w(3,5)=1 — the subarray is [5,2,1], and each of 1,2,5 occur exactly once in this subarray. Of these, only 1 equals the number of its occurrences in this subarray.

Given A, your task is to compute the sum of the weirdness of all subarrays of A, i.e, the value
∑L=1N​∑R=LN​w(L,R)
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N, the size of the given array.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​ — the elements of A.

Output Format
For each test case, output a single line containing a single integer — the sum of the weirdness of all subarrays of the given array.
Constraints


1≤T≤103
1≤N≤106
1≤Ai​≤106
The sum of N across all test cases does not exceed 106.

Explanation:
Test Case 1: The only subarray with non-zero weirdness is the whole array, which has w(1,3)=3 because every value is 3 and it appears thrice.
Test Case 2: There are 10 subarrays. Their weirdness values are as follows:

w(1,1)=1, because A1​=1 and f1,1​(1)=1.
w(1,2)=1, because A1​=1 and f1,2​(1)=1; but A2​=2 and f1,2​(2)=1=2.
w(1,3)=0, here f1,3​(1)=2=1 and f1,3​(2)=1=2 so no index satisfies the condition.
w(1,4)=2, here indices 2 and 4 satisfy the condition.
w(2,2)=0
w(2,3)=1, index 3 satisfies the condition.
w(2,4)=3, all indices satisfy the condition.
w(3,3)=1
w(3,4)=1, index 3 satisfies the condition.
w(4,4)=0
