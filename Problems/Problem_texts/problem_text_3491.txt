Chef has an array a1​,…,an​ of n elements. He wants you to answer queries of the following type:
Compute f(L,R), where f(L,R)=∑i=LR​∑j=iR​gcd(ai​,ai+1​,…aj​). In other words, we want to compute the sum of the greatest common divisors over all subarrays of some range [L,R].
Help Chef answer q queries of the described type.
Input:
The first line contains two integers n and q - the size of the array and the number of queries.
The second line contains n integers a1​,…,an​.
Each of the following q lines contains two integers l, r.
The queries are encrypted. Let the answer to the previous query be x (or 0 if there is none). The query is decrypted as follows: L=((l+x)modn)+1 and R=((r+x)modn)+1.
Output:
Print q integers - the answer to each query modulo 109+7.
Constraints
1≤n≤2⋅105
1≤q≤106
1≤ai​≤109

Explanation:
The decoded queries are respectively f(1,5); f(3,4); f(2,5); f(3,5); f(1,3); f(2,4)
