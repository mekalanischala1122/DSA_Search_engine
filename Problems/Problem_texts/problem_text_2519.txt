Arun has a rooted tree of N vertices rooted at vertex 1. Each vertex can either be coloured black or white.
Initially, the vertices are coloured A1​,A2​,…AN​, where Ai​∈{0,1} denotes the colour of the i-th vertex (here 0 represents white and 1 represents black). He wants to perform some operations to change the colouring of the vertices to B1​,B2​,…BN​ respectively.
Arun can perform the following operation any number of times. In one operation, he can choose any subtree and either paint all its vertices white or all its vertices black.
Help Arun find the minimum number of operations required to change the colouring of the vertices to B1​,B2​,…BN​ respectively.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N — the size of the tree.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​ denoting the initial colouring of the vertices of the tree.
The third line of each test case contains N space-separated integers B1​,B2​,…,BN​ denoting the final desired colouring of the vertices of the tree.
The next N−1 lines contain two space-separated integers u and v — denoting an undirected edge between nodes u and v.

It is guaranteed that the edges given in the input form a tree.
Output Format
For each testcase, output the minimum number of operations required to obtain the desired colouring.

Explanation:
Test case 1: Arun can choose the subtree rooted at 3 and paint it black in one operation to achieve the desired colouring.

Test case 2: Consider the following sequence of operations.
![sample2_part1](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codechef_shared/download/Images/START41/sample2_pt1.png =250x250)
In the first operation, choose the subtree rooted at 3 and paint it black.
![sample2_part2](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codechef_shared/download/Images/START41/sample2_pt2.png =250x250)
In the second operation, choose the subtree rooted at 2 and paint it white.
![sample2_part3](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codechef_shared/download/Images/START41/sample2_pt3.png =250x250)
It can be shown that the desired colouring cannot be obtained in fewer operations.
