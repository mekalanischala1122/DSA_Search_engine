A good number is a positive integer which is not divisible by the cube (third power) of any prime. For example, 2, 3, 25=5⋅5, 63=7⋅9 and 2057=11⋅11⋅17 are good numbers, but 8=2⋅2⋅2, 9317=7⋅11⋅11⋅11 and 2401=7⋅7⋅7⋅7 are not good numbers.
A pair of positive integers (x,y) is special if x⋅y is a good number. A set of positive integers is nice if each pair of different integers from this set is special. In particular, the empty set is nice.
You are given a set of integers {A1​,A2​,…,AN​}. Find the number of nice subsets of this set.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of nice subsets.
Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤N≤40
1≤Ai​≤108 for each valid i
A1​,A2​,…,AN​ are pairwise distinct
