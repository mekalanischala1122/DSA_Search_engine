For an array A of N integers, define

An array P of length N, where Pi​ is the number of distinct elements in the subarray A[1:i] of A.
An array S of length N, where Si​ is the number of distinct elements in the subarray A[i:N] of A.

You are given arrays P and S. Determine whether there exists an array A corresponding to the given P and S arrays.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
Each test case consists of three lines of input.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers P1​,P2​…PN​.
The third line of each test case contains N space-separated integers S1​,S2​…SN​.



Output Format
For each test case, output the answer on a new line: if there does not exist any array A producing such P and S arrays, then output NO, otherwise output YES
You can output each letter in any case.
Constraints


1≤T≤104
1≤N≤105
1≤Pi​≤N
1≤Si​≤N
The sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅105

Explanation:
Test case 1: We have P=[1,2,3] and S=[3,2,1].
Consider A=[1,2,3].

The number of distinct elements in the 1st prefix [1] is 1.
The number of distinct elements in the 2nd prefix [1,2] is 2.
The number of distinct elements in the 3rd prefix [1,2,3] is 3.

and

The number of distinct elements in the 1st suffix [1,2,3] is 3.
The number of distinct elements in the 2nd suffix [2,3] is 2.
The number of distinct elements in the 3rd suffix [3] is 1.

Clearly A produces the given P and S.
Test case 2: We have P=[2,2,3,3] , S=[3,2,2,1].
It can be proven that there does not exist any array A which produces the given P and S.
Test case 3: We have P=[1,1], S=[1,1].
Consider A=[7,7].

The number of distinct elements in the 1st prefix [7] is 1.
The number of distinct elements in the 2nd prefix [7,7] is 1.

and

The number of distinct elements in the 1st suffix [7,7] is 1.
The number of distinct elements in the 2nd suffix [7] is 1.

Clearly A produces the given P and S.
Test case 4: P=[1,2,1] , S=[2,2,1].
It can be proven that there does not exist any array A which produces the given P and S.
