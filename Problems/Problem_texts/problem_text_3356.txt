There are two sequences A1​,A2​,…,AN​ and B1​,B2​,…,BN​. Answer Q queries on these sequences.
In each query, you should calculate the dot product of subsequences Ax​,Ax+1​,…,Ax+l−1​ and By​,By+1​,…,By+l−1​, i.e. the value of the expression
∑k=0l−1​Ax+k​By+k​.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.
The third line contains N space-separated integers B1​,B2​,…,BN​.
Each of the following Q lines contains three space-separated integers x, y and l describing one query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer — the answer to the query (the dot product).
