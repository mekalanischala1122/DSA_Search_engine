Given an array A having N elements, Chef wonders how many pairs (i,j) exists such that 1≤i<j≤N, and Ai​⋅Aj​ is divisible by i⋅j.
Can you help Chef in finding the number of such pairs?
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of the T testcases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of elements in A.
The second line of each test case contains N space separated integers A1​,A2​,...,AN​.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer denoting the number of pairs that satisfies the above condition.
Constraints


1≤T≤104
2≤N≤105
1≤Ai​≤105
The sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 105

Explanation:
Test Case 1: For all possible pairs of {i,j}, Ai​⋅Aj​ is divisible by i⋅j.
Test Case 2: The condition holds for the following two pairs of {i,j}: {1,2}, {1,4}.
