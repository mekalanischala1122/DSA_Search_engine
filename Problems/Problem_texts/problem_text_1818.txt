Cherry has a binary matrix A consisting of N rows and M columns. The rows are numbered from 1 to N, columns are numbered from 1 to M. Element at row i (1 ≤ i ≤ N) and column j (1 ≤ j ≤ M) is denoted as Aij​. All elements of A are either 0 or 1.
He performs Q queries on matrix. Each query is provided by four integers x1​, y1​, x2​, y2​ which define the rectangle, where (x1​, y1​) stands for the coordinates of the top left cell of the rectangle, while (x2​, y2​) stands for the coordinates of the bottom right cell. You need to flip all the bits i.e. (0 to 1, 1 to 0) that are located fully inside the query rectangle.
Finally, print the matrix after performing all the queries.
Note: x1​ represents the row number while y1​ represents the column number.
Input:

The first line of the input contains two integers N and M — the number of rows and the number of columns in the matrix.
Each of the next N lines contains a string of length M, where the jth character of ith line denotes the value of Ai,j​.
Next line contains an integer Q — the number of queries.
Then follow Q lines with queries descriptions. Each of them contains four space-seperated integers x1​, y1​, x2​, y2​ — coordinates of the up left and bottom right cells of the query rectangle.

Output:
Print the matrix, in the form of N strings, after performing all the queries.

Explanation:
Example case 1:
After processing the 1st query 1 1 1 1, matrix becomes:
[1000​]
After processing the 2nd query 2 2 2 2, the matrix becomes:
[1001​]
After processing the 3rd query 1 1 2 2, matrix becomes:
[0110​]
We need to output the matrix after processing all queries.
