"We’ve already come too far to end this now".
N players advance to the fifth round and the game is going to be Hopscotch. Every player has to select one mannequin before the start of the game.
Players are numbered 1 to N. You are given an array A of size N, where

If Ai​=i, the ith player selects their own mannequin.
If Ai​=j where j=i, the ith player decides the mannequin for the jth player.
If Ai​=0, the ith player hasn’t decided yet.

The VIPs want to know the number of ways that the undecided players can select mannequins such that everyone gets a mannequin, and no undecided players select their own mannequin.
It is guaranteed that every (non-zero) element in A is unique, i.e, if 1≤i,j≤N are such that i=j,Ai​>0, and Aj​>0, then Ai​=Aj​.
Since the answer can be very large, print it modulo 109+7.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of players.
The second line contains N space-separated integers, the ith of which is Ai​ as described in the statement above.

Output Format
For every test case, print one line containing the number of ways undecided players can select mannequins for others such that everyone receives a mannequin, modulo 109+7.
Constraints


1≤T≤103
1≤N≤103

Explanation:
Test Case 1: There is no undecided player, so the number of ways is 0.
Test Case 2: There are 3 ways for the last 3 players to decide mannequins, all of which are listed below:

4→2,5→4,6→5
4→5,5→4,6→2
4→5,5→2,6→4

where a→b means that a selects the mannequin for b.
