You are given an array A containing N integers. A subsequence of this array is called good if all the elements of this subsequence are distinct.
Find the number of good non-empty subsequences of A. This number can be large, so report it modulo 109+7.
Note that two subsequences are considered different if they differ in the indices chosen. For example, in the array [1,1] there are 3 different non-empty subsequences: [1] (the first element), [1] (the second element) and [1,1]. Out of these three subsequences, the first two are good and the third is not.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, denoting the number of elements in A.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of good subsequences modulo 109+7
Constraints
