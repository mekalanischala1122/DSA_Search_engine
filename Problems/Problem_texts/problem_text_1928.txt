Chef was impressed by an array A of N non-negative integers. But, he was asked to solve the following problem in order to get this array.
Given a non-negative integer k, find the number of pairs (i,j) (1≤i<j≤N) such that the following condition holds true:
(Ai​ ∣ Aj​) + (Ai​⊕Aj​) + (Ai​ &amp; Aj​) =k +Aj​, where

(Ai​∣Aj​) denotes Bitwise OR operation,
(Ai​ ⊕ Aj​) denotes Bitwise XOR operation,
(Ai​ &amp; Aj​) denotes Bitwise AND operation.

You, being Chef's friend, help him get this array by solving the above problem.
Input Format

The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and k, the number of integers in the array A and the non-negative integer k respectively.
The next line contains N space-separated non-negative integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​, the elements of the array A.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing the number of pairs satisfying the mentioned condition.
Constraints


1≤T≤200
1≤N≤105
0≤k≤1018
0≤Ai​≤1018
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅105.

Explanation:
Test case 1: The input array contains only a single integer. Thus, no pairs are possible.
Test case 2: There are two pairs satisfying the condition -

(i,j)=(1,2): A1​=1 and A2​=6. Thus, (1∣6)+(1⊕6)+(1 &amp; 6)=7+7+0=14. Also, k+A2​=8+6=14.
(i,j)=(2,3): A2​=6 and A3​=4. Thus, (6∣4)+(6⊕4)+(6 &amp; 4)=6+2+4=12. Also, k+A3​=8+4=12.
