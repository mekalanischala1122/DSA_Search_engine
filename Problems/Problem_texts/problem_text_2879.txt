Chef John is given N points P1​,P2​,…,PN​ in a plane. For each valid i, the coordinates of the point Pi​ are (xi​,yi​). Help him find a vector v=(xv​,yv​) such that the following holds:

For each i (1≤i≤N), let Si​=v⋅Pi​Pi+1​​. Here, we define PN+1​=P1​.
The coordinates xv​ and yv​ are integers and ∣xv​∣,∣yv​∣≤2⋅109.
It is possible to find three integers w, l and r (1≤l≤r≤N) such that:

For each i (l≤i≤r), Si​w>0.
For each other valid i, Si​w<0.



If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one. If there are no solutions, let's define xv​=yv​=0. (Note that the vector v=(0,0) cannot be a valid solution.)
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
N lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers xi​ and yi​.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing two space-separated integers xv​ and yv​.
Constraints

1≤T≤5
3≤N≤105
∣xi​∣,∣yi​∣≤5⋅108 for each valid i
