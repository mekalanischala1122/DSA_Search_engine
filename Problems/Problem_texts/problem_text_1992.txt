Chef recently took a course in linear algebra and learned about linear combinations of vectors. Therefore, in order to test his intelligence, Raj gave him a "fuzzy" problem to solve.
A sequence of integers B1​,B2​,…,BM​ generates an integer K if it is possible to find a sequence of integers C1​,C2​,…,CM​ such that C1​⋅B1​+C2​⋅B2​+…+CM​⋅BM​=K.
In this problem, Chef has a sequence A1​,A2​,…,AN​ and he should answer Q queries. In each query, he is given an integer K; the answer to this query is the number of pairs (l,r) such that 1≤l≤r≤N and the subsequence (Al​,Al+1​,…,Ar​) generates K.
Chef has no idea how to solve this problem ― can you help him find the answers to all queries?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.
The third line contains a single integer Q.
The following Q lines describe queries. Each of these lines contains a single integer K.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of contiguous subsequences that generate K.
Constraints

Explanation:
The sequence (2,4) has three contiguous subsequences: (2), (4) and (2,4).

In the first query, 1 cannot be generated by any subsequence.
In the second query, 2 is generated by subsequences (2) and (2,4). For example, for the subsequence (2,4), we can choose C1​=1 and C2​=0.
In the third query, 8 is generated by all three subsequences.
