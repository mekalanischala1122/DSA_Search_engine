Problem
A permutation P of length N (1-based) is called good if it satisfies the following these conditions:

For each 1≤i≤N, Pi​=i
∣P1​−1∣⊕∣P2​−2∣⊕…⊕∣PN​−N∣=0

Here, ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation and ∣X∣ denotes the absolute value of X.
Find any good permutation P of length N or print −1 if no such permutation exists.
Note: A permutation of length N is an array which contains every integer from 1 to N (inclusive) exactly once.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains an integer N - the length of the permutation P.

Output Format
For each test case, print −1 if no such permutation exists. Otherwise, in a single line, output N space-separated integers - the required good permutation. If more than one solution exists, you may print any of them.
Constraints


1≤T≤106
1≤N≤106
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106

Explanation:
Test case 1: There is only one permutation P=[1] of length 1. Since P1​=1 the answer does not exist.
Test case 2: Consider the permutation P=[2,1]. Both conditions are satisfied.

P1​=1 and P2​=2
∣P1​−1∣⊕∣P2​−2∣=∣2−1∣⊕∣1−2∣=1⊕1=0

Test case 3: Both conditions are satisfied for P=[7,1,5,6,3,4,8,2].
