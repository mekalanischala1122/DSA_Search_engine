Tsetso likes to play with arrays.
An Array A[1,2,…,N] is said to be a Tsetso array if A[1]⋅A[N]=max(A1​,A2​,…,AN−1​,AN​).
Bedo, his teammate, likes to solve problems so much, so Tsetso gave him an array A of N distinct integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​ and Q queries of the form [L,R] and asked him to count the number of Tsetso subarrays in the given range.
A subarray[L,R] is to be a Tsetso subarray if A[L]⋅A[R]=max(AL​,AL+1​,....,AR−1​,AR​).
Bedo spent a lot of time trying to solve it, but he couldn't, can you?
Note: A sequence a is a subarray of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.
Input Format

First-line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of input contains two space-separated integers N and Q, the number of elements in the array, and the number of queries.
The second line contains N distinct space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.
Then Q lines follow each line containing two space-separated integers L,R.

Output Format
For each query, output in a single line the number of Tsetso subarrays in the given range [L,R].
Constraints

Explanation:

All the valid subarrays are [1,6],[2,4],[3,5],[4,5],[5,5],[5,6],[4,7].
One of the invalid subarrays is [1,3],3⋅24=max(3,6,24)
