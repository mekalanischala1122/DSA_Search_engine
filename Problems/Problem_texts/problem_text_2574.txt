You are given a binary string S. You can perform the following operations on S:

Flip: Pick an index i (1≤i≤∣S∣) and flip the i-th character (i.e change 1 to 0 or 0 to 1). For e.g. 011​001→010​001
Compress: Pick any non-empty substring consisting of the same character and replace it with a single occurrence of that character. For e.g. 1001111​10→1001​10

You want to make all the characters of the binary string equal (i.e. either all characters are 0 or all characters are 1). Find the minimum number of operations required to do so.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string S.

Output Format
For each test case, output a single line containing one integer - the minimum number of operations required to make all the characters of S equal.
Constraints


1≤T≤105
1≤∣S∣≤106
S is a binary string.
It is guaranteed that the sum of ∣S∣ over all test cases does not exceed 106.
