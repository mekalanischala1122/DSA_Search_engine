You are given arrays A and B of length N each. Determine the number of good pairs.
A pair (i,j) (1≤i,j≤N) is said to be good if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

i<j;
Ai​=Bj​;
Aj​=Bi​;

Input Format

First line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.

Description of each test case:

First line contains an integer N - denoting the length of the arrays.
Second line contains N space-separated integers A1​,A2​,…AN​ - denoting the array A.
Third line contains N space-separated integers B1​,B2​,…BN​ - denoting the array B.

Output Format
For each test case, output the number of good pairs.
Constraints


1≤T≤1000
2≤N≤105
1≤Ai​,Bi​≤109
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

Explanation:
Test Case 1: The only good pair (i,j) is (1,3). Here,

1<3
A1​=1 and B3​=1. Thus, A1​=B3​.
A3​=3 and B1​=3. Thus, A3​=B1​.

Test Case 2: There are no good pairs.
Test Case 3: There are 3 good pairs (i,j). These are (1,2),(1,3), and (2,3).
Test Case 4: There are 2 good pairs (i,j). These are (1,2) and (3,4).
